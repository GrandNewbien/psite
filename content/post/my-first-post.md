It's funny - I heard creativity is intelligence having fun, but for the good part of my recent existence, my intelligence seems to be rotting in a pile of rotten bananas - You know, the kind you see in cartoons from which the green aura emerges and the fruit flies actively buzzing around.

It's a little odd quite frankly. Writing without referring to a predefined rubric, or criteria, or the standing instructions that everything must be cited and backed up by solid and conclusive evidence, and not to mention your own thoughts towards it; it feels... experimental. Without regard for the grammar police or my run on sentences which, I admit, is something I do way too often (see previous sentence), writing feels... liberating. For the first time in a long time, writing feels...like a new truth.

The last time time stamp on this site is when it was created, by my then-boyfriend and now-fiance - October 4th, 2018 at 1:16am. Why thank you fiance, precisely 7 months 23 days and 22 hours later. I say this as I twirl the ring on my finger with a giant yawn glued to my face and disappointment drawn all over it - all attributed to the fact that I have to sleep because my 9-5 corporate job awaits me. And because of that, I am out - good night world, I shall be back - this is Yoko Neli peacing out.

Hey gurl,

I love you more than you know. I await eagerly for your thoughts :)
