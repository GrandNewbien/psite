Poetry.

I have always been fond poetry - from writing it, to reading it; but I think most of all, I enjoy it because I find poetry in the small, every-day happenings of life around me. 

I watch the steam lift itself from the cooking pot in a seemingly infinite manner and I find it liberating yet peaceful. The way it dances to its freedom. It's a story in itself.

The way the candle burns in its lantern - peaceful and violent in concert. 

The way the leaves of the plants slowly wave themselves in the warm summer breeze as the honey glow of the sunset aura drapes them.

The crackling sound of the fireplace, making you yearn for the warm embrace of your lover under warm blankets on cold nights.

Poetry is all around us, we just have to allow ourselves to be immersed in it as we navigate through the chaotic pace of life.
